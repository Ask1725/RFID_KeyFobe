# RFID & Electromagnetic Card Security System for Automotives
This project incorporates RFID and Electromagnetic Card technology for automotive security by controlling access to vehicles and preventing unauthorized access.

## Components
- Arduino UNO
- RFID Module (RC522)
- Electromagnetic Card
- Servo Motor
- LCD Display
- Buzzer

## How it Works
The system uses an RFID reader to authenticate authorized users. Valid RFID cards allow access, while invalid ones trigger an alarm. The door is opened using a servo motor.

## Code
The Arduino IDE code can be found in the `code/` directory.

## Documentation
Detailed project report and diagrams are available in the `docs/` folder.
